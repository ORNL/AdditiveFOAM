This feature is enabled using the execute flag in the constant/foamToExaCADict file. The solidification conditions at the specified isotherm is tracked in the represenative volume element defined by box and a resolution defined by dx. It is recommended to track the liquidus isotherm. Users should be warned that this interpolation may cause a significant load-balancing issues if the resolution of the ExaCA data is much finer than that of the AdditiveFOAM mesh, and therefore, this feature should be used selectively.
