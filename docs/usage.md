## Running a simulation
To run an AdditiveFOAM simulation, it is recommended to perform the following steps:
1. Prepare the case directory structure using a provided template:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p $FOAM_RUN/additivefoam
   cd $FOAM_RUN/additivefoam
   cp -r $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/AdditiveFOAM/tutorials/AMB2018-02-B userCase
   cd userCase
   ```

2. Modify the necessary input files according to your simulation requirements. These files are described in [Case Files](#case-files).

3. Run the simulation using shell scripting. Examples are provided in the `Allrun` scripts in each tutorial which creates a mesh, decomposes the mesh across multiple processors, and runs the AdditiveFOAM case in parallel using [MPI](https://www.mpi-forum.org/).

   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   cd ${0%/*} || exit 1    # Run from this directory
   
   # Source tutorial run functions
   . $WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/tools/RunFunctions

   application=`getApplication`
   
   runApplication blockMesh
   runApplication decomposePar
   runParallel $application

   runApplication reconstructPar
   ```

4. Visualize and post-process the results using [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/)
   ```bash
   touch case.foam
   paraview case.foam
   ```
   
## AdditiveFOAM file structure

### case files

An AdditiveFOAM case directory has a typical organization like:
```
|-- case-directory/
|   |-- 0/
|   |   |-- alpha.powder
|   |   |-- alpha.solid
|   |   |-- p_rgh
|   |   |-- T
|   |   |-- U
|   |
|   |-- constant/
|   |   |-- heatSourceDict
|   |   |-- scanPath
|   |   |-- transportProperties
|   |   |-- thermoPath
|   |
|   |-- system/
|   |   |-- blockMeshDict
|   |   |-- controlDict
|   |   |-- fvScheme
|   |   |-- fvSolution
|   |
|   +-- ..
```

- `0`: Directory containing the initial conditions and boundary conditions for each field. The fields are specified by their file name:
  - `T`:            temperature             (required)
  - `U`:            velocity                (optional)
  - `p_rgh`:        reduced pressure        (optional)
  - `alpha.solid`:  solid volume fraction   (optional)
  - `alpha.powder`: powder volume fraction  (optional)

- `constant`: Directory containing the definitions for material conditions, including:

  - `transportProperties`: File that defines the transport properties of the material. An example of this file for IN625 is:
    ```cpp
    solid
    {
        kappa   (8.275  0.01472   0.0);
        Cp      (579.28 0.0       0.0);
    }

    liquid
    {
        kappa   (4.889    0.014743  0.0);
        Cp      (750.65   0.0       0.0);
    }

    powder
    {
        kappa   (-0.07707   0.00075   0.0);
        Cp      (747.568    0.0       0.0);
    }

    rho     [1 -3 0 0 0 0 0]    7569.92;   // reference density
    mu      [1 -1 -1  0 0 0 0]  0.003032;  // dynamic viscosity
    beta    [0 0 0 -1 0 0 0]    1.2e-4;    // coefficient of thermal expansion
    DAS     [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]     10e-6;     // dendrite arm spacing (for drag)
    Lf      [0  2 -2  0 0 0 0]  2.1754e5;  // latent heat of fusion
    ```
   The thermal conductivity `kappa` and specific heat `Cp` are given as temperature dependent second-order polynomials for the `solid`, `liquid`, and `powder` phases. The remaining transport properties are all assumed to be constant during the simulation.

  - `heatSourceDict`: File that defines the number and mathematical form of moving heat sources in the simulation. An example of this file is:
    ```cpp
    sources (beam);

    beam
    {
        pathName            scanPath;    

        absorptionModel     constant;
        
        constantCoeffs
        {
            eta             0.3;
        }
        
        heatSourceModel     superGaussian;
        
        superGaussianCoeffs
        {
            k               2.0;
            dimensions      (85.0e-6 85.0e-6 30e-6);
            nPoints         (10 10 10);
        }
    }
    ```

     The available entries for the absorption models are:
     - `constant`
     - [`Kelly`](https://opg.optica.org/ao/fulltext.cfm?uri=ao-5-6-925&id=14272): An effective absorption is calculated based of the geometry and apsect ratio of the heat source shape to simulate keyhole formation.

     The available entries for the heatSourceModel are:
     - `superGaussian`
     - `modifiedSuperGaussian`
       
     {: .custom }
     Each heat source model can dynamically update its depth to the a specified isotherm position by setting the `transient` flag to `True`. The recommended value for `isoValue` is the alloy liquidus temperature for simulating keyhole formation.

  - `thermoPath`: File that tabulates the temperature-solid fraction relationship. An example path for a linear transition between the eutetic and liquidus temperatures for IN625 is:
    ```
    (
        1410.0000    1.0000
        1620.0000    0.0000
    )
   ```

- `system`: Directory containing simulation configuration files.
  - `controlDict`: File that sets simulation time settings and numerical parameters.
  - `fvSchemes`: File that sets the discretization schemes used to solve the governing equations.
  - `fvSolution`: File that sets solution algorithms and convergence criteria.
  
    {: .custom }
    Fluid flow can be turned off by setting `nOuterCorrectors` to `0` in the `PIMPLE` dictionary.

    {: .custom }
    The thermodynamic algorithm settings are defined in the `PIMPLE` dictionary. The optional `explicitSolve` enables a first-order explicit solution to the temperature equation whenever the solution is numerically stable, providing computational speedup over the implicit solution.
    ```cpp
    PIMPLE
    {
        momentumPredictor no;
        nOuterCorrectors 0;
        nCorrectors     1;
        nNonOrthogonalCorrectors 0;
        pRefCell        0;
        pRefValue       0;


        nThermoCorrectors   20;
        thermoTolerance     1e-8;
        explicitSolve       true;
    }
    ```

### Scan path file
AdditiveFOAM supports a scan path file format that decomposes the laser path into segments that are either a) line sources (mode = 0) or b) point sources (mode = 1).

An example scan path file for a bi-directional raster with a hatch-spacing of 100 $$\mu m$$ is:
```
Mode    X       Y       Z     Power   Parameter
1       0.000   0.000   0.0   0.0     0.0
0       0.002   0.000   0.0   195.0   0.8
0       0.002   0.0001  0.0   0.0     0.8
0       0.000   0.0001  0.0   195.0   0.8
```

The beam starts at (0, 0, 0) $$m$$ and moves horizontally to (0.002, 0, 0.0) $$m$$ with a power of 195 $$W$$ and speed of 0.8 $$m/s$$. Then, the laser turns off and moves vertically to (0.002, 0.0001, 0.0) $$m$$ at a speed of 0.8 $$m/s$$. Finally, the laser moves horizontally to (0.002, 0.0001, 0.0) $$m$$ with a power of 195 $$W$$ and speed of 0.8 $$m/s$$. At this point, the laser turns off for the remainder of the simulation.

A summary of the entries defining a path segment for the scan path is provided in the following table:

| Column   | Description                                                                                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Column 1 | Mode = 0: line source, <br>Mode = 1: point source                                                                               |
| Columns 2-4 | Mode = 0: the final (x,y,z) position of the beam in meters. <br>Mode = 1: the current (x,y,z) position of the beam in meters |
| Column 5 | Value for laser power in watts                                                                                               |
| Column 6 | Mode = 0: the speed of the beam in meters/second. <br>Mode = 1: the time the beam remains at its current position in seconds                         |

## AdditiveFOAM output

### ExaCA data
AdditiveFOAM is can export thermal data to [ExaCA](https://github.com/LLNL/ExaCA), a cellular automata (CA) code for grain growth under additive manufacturing conditions. 

This feature is enabled using the `execute` flag in the `constant/foamToExaCADict` file. The solidification conditions at the specified `isotherm` is tracked in the represenative volume element defined by `box` and a resolution defined by `dx`. An example file for tracking the liquidus temperature the RVE for the above scan path is:
```cpp
execute     on;

box         (0 -0.0001 -0.0002) (0.002 0.0002 0);
dx          2.5e-6;
isotherm    1620;
```

{: .warning }
It is recommended to track the liquidus isotherm to remain consistent with the assumptions in ExaCA. Users should be warned that this interpolation may requires significant computation overhead when the resolution of the ExaCA data is much finer than that of the AdditiveFOAM mesh, and therefore, this feature should be used selectively.
