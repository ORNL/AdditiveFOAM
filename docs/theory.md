## Governing equations
### Assumptions
We make the following assumptions:
* Incompressibility (constant density)

#### Weak form
The heat equation without phase change is given by:

$$
\rho C_p(T) \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot \left(k(T)\nabla T\right) = Q,
$$

where $$\rho$$ is the density, $$C_p$$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, $$T$$, is the
temperature, $$k$$ is the thermal conductivity, and $$Q$$ is the volumetric heat
source term.
